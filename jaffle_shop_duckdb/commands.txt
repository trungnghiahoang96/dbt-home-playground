rm jaffle_shop.duckdb


dbt clean

dbt seed


dbt seed --models raw_customers


default connect to duckdb is read/write connection
DuckDB only accept maybe multiple read only connections and 1 write connection
Current we can access to file.duckdb by DBeaver or duckcli with one connection at time style
It also meaning that when we connect to file.duckdb DBeaver with duckcli --> we can not use dbt to make chang to that database (dbt need to connect to)
after dbt run --> refresh the dbeaver connect to access to new database




duckcli jaffle_shop.duckdb
\dt 


dbt run --select customers
--> fail when stg_customers does not exist

dbt run --select +customers
--> successful because it will also run upstream models for us (not only stg_customers but also stg_orders and stg_payments)
----> behaviors are the all staging layers models will be materialized (as view - staging should be views)


test other idea --> run stag_customers down stream to observe the results
dbt clean
rm jaffle_shop.duckdb
dbt seed
dbt run --select stg_customers+

---> fail because of a model upstream customers need 1 more model stg_orders
Catalog Error: Table with name stg_orders does not exist!
